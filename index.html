      <p>„Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ (hellllloooo!) You've stumbled (intentionally?) onto my site. I'm Paul. I love play, and making smiles happen.</p>

      <p>Day-to-day, I help fuel people who eat with purpose over at <a href="https://www.mypowersupply.com" target="_blank">Power Supply</a>, where I design + make things.</p>

      <p>I live in California üåÖüíñ. I help organize a design meetup called <a href="http://designershearth.com" target="_blank">Designer's Hearth</a> in the heart of Silicon Valley. My favorite part is sharing experiences betwixt other designers. We help each other grow.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, I write about the things we explore as a design community. Just recently, <a href="http://twitter.com/brim">Brittany</a> (my better half) and I wrote a guide together called <i><a href="http://portfolio.enchant.co" target="_blank">Crafting Your UX Portfolio: a weekend guide to getting it done</a></i>. If you work with screens + digital stuff, I bet you'll dig it.</p>

      <p>In the past, I helped build + grow a company called <a href="http://americanparkour.com/" target="_blank">American Parkour</a>. Our mission was (and still is) to promote, teach, and advance the discipline of parkour. I was a professional athlete, sponsored + paid to travel the world, inspiring others to move.</p>

      <p>Starting to catch the pattern here? Nutrition, fitness, health... it all runs close to my heart.</p>

      <p>I also ran a design studio called <a href="http://enchant.co">Enchant</a>, helping small businesses and startups build authentic companies through software. Nowadays, it's what Brittany and I use to explore our fun projects.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="http://twitter.com/pvm" target="_blank">find me on Twitter</a> waxing on about things I care about (like design, psychology, startup-y topics, technology, and people. I love people.) For a glimspe into things that make *me* happy, you can <a href="http://instagram.com/pvmederos" target="_blank">catch my Instagram feed here</a>.</p>
